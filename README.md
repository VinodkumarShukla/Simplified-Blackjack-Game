# Simplified-Blackjack-Game

Description:
The Simplified Blackjack Game is a Python program that offers a simplified version of the classic card game, Blackjack (also known as twenty-one). In this game, the player competes against a computerized dealer. The goal is to obtain a hand of cards that sum as close to 21 as possible without exceeding that value.

Key Features:

Initial Deal: At the start of a new hand, the player is dealt two random cards from a simplified deck containing values from 1 to 10. Suits are ignored in this version of the game.
Player's Turn: The player can choose to either "HIT" (receive an additional card) or "STAY" (stick with the current hand) in an attempt to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible.
Bust Check: If the sum of the card values in the player's hand exceeds 21, the player loses the hand. This is referred to as "going bust."
Dealer's Turn: After the player chooses to "STAY," it's the dealer's turn. The computerized dealer is assigned a random score within the range of 16-21.
Winning Condition: The player wins if the computerized dealer's score is less than the player's total hand value and does not exceed 21. Otherwise, the player loses the hand.
Replay: After the hand is resolved, the player can choose to play another round of Blackjack.
User-Friendly Interface: The game provides a user-friendly text-based interface for interaction.
